# First Assignment
This is the first assignment for CS325

## Things I Learned
Don't use the same name for decorator functions and python library functions. This caused some issues for me when I tried to do the following code, as my decorator was also called round. An error about trying to pass two arguments to a function with one argument was how I found out where I went wrong.
<code> rounded = round(args[0], 3) </code>
